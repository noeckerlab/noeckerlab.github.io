### **Prospective or current undergraduates:**
Undergraduate students are welcome to join the lab and work on a research project for course credit, for work study through the Undergraduate Research Center, or potentially as a volunteer depending on the circumstances. No specific qualifications or previous research experience are required, just enthusiasm and commitment to participate fully and respect [lab expectations](../lab_culture).

If you are interested, please read about our [project areas](../research). Send an email to [Dr. Noecker](mail:cecilia.noecker@mnsu.edu) with a brief introduction and which project area(s) sounds most interesting to you and why.
