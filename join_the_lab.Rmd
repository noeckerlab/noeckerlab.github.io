### **Prospective or current undergraduates:**
Undergraduate students are welcome to join the lab and work on a research project for course credit, for pay through the Undergraduate Research Center Research Apprenticeship Programs, or potentially as a volunteer depending on the circumstances. No specific qualifications or previous research experience are required, just enthusiasm and commitment to participate fully and respect [lab expectations](../lab_culture).

If you are interested, please read about our [project areas](../research) and **fill out [this brief Microsoft Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xscRULQKq0ae9PrnSpIafwuugNwK8CdKjj1LqndxT1VURFRKREVPU0JWMk9RSzZRUjRLNzc4T0IzNC4u)** (only accessible if you are logged in with your MinnState account). Dr. Noecker will follow up with you by email. We welcome new lab members at the beginning of both fall and spring semesters, but space may be limited. 

<!-- If you are interested, please fill out [this brief Microsoft Form]() (only accessible if you are logged in with your MNSU account). Dr. Noecker will follow up with you by email.

### **Prospective M.S. Biological Sciences students:**
Prospective M.S. students are encouraged to contact Dr. Noecker and to apply for admission to the Minnesota State Mankato [Biological Sciences M.S.](https://grad.mnsu.edu/all-graduate-programs/biology-master-of-science/) If you are interested, send an email to Dr. Noecker with your resume or C.V. and a few sentences on your educational background and why you are interested in our lab specifically. 

We receive more emails from prospective graduate students than we can respond to; **you can increase your chance of a response by writing in your own voice** (no AI! Grammar errors are OK). See also this [helpful guide](https://sites.google.com/view/apply-academic-positions/graduate-student) created by Dr. Lily Khadempour about how to contact a prospective graduate advisor. 

The Mankato metropolitan area is home to ~105,000 residents and is located 80 miles southwest of the Twin Cities, at the intersection of the Minnesota and Blue Earth rivers. Minnesota State Mankato is the second-largest university in Minnesota. See [here](https://www.mnsu.edu/about-msu/) to learn more about the campus community.

### **M.S. Data Science students:**
We may have opportunities for Data Science students to work on a co-advised thesis project or alternative plan paper in bioinformatics/computational biology. Ideally, you should have taken or plan to take at least two statistics courses and have a little bit of background or interest in microbiology. Please read over our [project areas](../research) and [expectations](../lab_culture) and send Dr. Noecker an email if you are interested.
